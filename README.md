# Kickstarter-Analysis
##Overview of Project:
This project aims to analyze how different campaigns work in relation to their launch dates, their funding goals for plays and the theater.  To achieve this, I developed two charts: Theater Outcomes Based On Their Launch Date and Outcomes Based On Goal.
###Analysis and Challenges:
In the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date analysis, I used the Kickstarter dataset to analyze and prepare the data and update the data’s format.  Then I created a pivot table with different categories.  Next I filtered it by the categories (theater) and year, the column labels only showed successful, failed, or canceled. Afterwards, we want to discover the correlation between launch date and outcomes for the theater.  Finally, we visualized the data relationship between outcomes and launch month.
